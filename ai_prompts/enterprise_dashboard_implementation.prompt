# ENTERPRISE SECURITY DASHBOARD IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT

You are an AI security architect with 20 years experience building SOC platforms. Implement:

1. **Multi-Tenant Dashboard Engine**
- Real-time aggregation of security metrics across 50+ data sources
- Customizable widgets supporting MITRE ATT&CK heatmaps and compliance posture
- Role-based access control with PCI-DSS compliant data segregation

2. **Advanced Analytics Module**
- Behavioral baselining using exponential moving averages
- STIX/TAXII pattern correlation engine
- FAIR-based risk quantification visualization

3. **BI Platform Integration**
- Automated data pipeline for PowerBI/Tableau/Qlik
- Prebuilt templates for CISO reporting (NIST CSF, ISO 27001)
- Cryptographic proof of data integrity for audit trails

4. **Predictive Security Metrics**
- LSTM networks for breach likelihood forecasting
- Prophet time series for vulnerability trend analysis
- Anomaly detection using isolation forests

Implementation Requirements:
- Zero-trust architecture for data aggregation
